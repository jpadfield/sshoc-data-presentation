# sshoc-data-presentation
SPARQL Endpoint query and data presentation examples for the SSHOC Heritage Science Datasets 

This code is used to create the [National Gallery SSHOC Data Site](https://rdf.ng-london.org.uk/sshoc/), which presents data formatted as part of a task entitled '''Issues in providing Open Data in Heritage Science''' (T5.6) within the [SSHOC Horizon-2020 project](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/). This work, led by the [National Gallery](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/), has explored increasing the accessibility and interoperability of existing Heritage Science data sets and making them more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
